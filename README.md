Data description: This data set features businesses/individuals holding a DCA license so that they may legally operate in New York City. 

**Potential Questions

Question 1: What businesses/industries are popular in different neighborhoods/boroughs? What about marginalized neighborhoods?

Question 2: Change in trends in business types and number of licenses given over time? What impact did COVID have on the same? What impact did various laws (We might need to do some research into these laws) passed in the past have on them? 

Question 3: Is there any bias involved when it comes to giving business licenses in marginalized neighborhoods?
