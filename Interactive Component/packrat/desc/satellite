Title: Handling and Manipulating Remote Sensing Data
Version: 1.0.4
Author: Thomas Nauss, Hanna Meyer, Tim Appelhans, Florian Detsch
Maintainer: Florian Detsch <fdetsch@web.de>
Description: Herein, we provide a broad variety of functions which are useful
    for handling, manipulating, and visualizing satellite-based remote sensing 
    data. These operations range from mere data import and layer handling (eg 
    subsetting), over Raster* typical data wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more 
    sophisticated (pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery 
    (eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality is 
    complemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any 
    stage and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file. 
    Currently available sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 
    (OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional compatibility is ensured for the Landsat 
    Global Land Survey data set.
