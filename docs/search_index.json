We have essentially answered the following three questions through this work: Question 1: What businesses/industries are popular in different neighborhoods? Question 2: Change in trends in business types and number of licenses given over time? What impact did COVID have on the same? What impact did various laws passed in the past have on them? Question 3: Is there any bias involved when it comes to issuing business licenses in marginalized neighborhoods? To answer these questions, we have analyzed two datasets provided by the Department of Consumer Affairs and reported our results in the coming sections. We have also created an interactive app using R shiny for the readers to play around with the dataset and figure out the answer for some of these questions by themselves. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Legally Operating Businesses in New York City Dataset 2.2 License Applications in New York City Dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources To answer the questions discussed in the previous sections, we used the data on license applications offered by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), New York City. In particular, we used the following two datasets: 2.1 Legally Operating Businesses in New York City Dataset Source : Legally Operating Businesses. Data provided by Agency: Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). Available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh. This data set features businesses/individuals holding a DCA license so that they may legally operate in New York City. It specifically focuses on licenses that were given starting in the 1970s. Of the many variables, the following were of particular interest to us: Business Industry type (Tobacco dealer, Home Improvement Contractor, etc) Business location (includes Zip, Borough, Council District, Longitudes, Latitudes) License type (Individual vs Business) License start and expiration dates Note: Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included in this data set. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCA extended certain license expiration dates and renewal application deadlines which are not reflected in this data set.

Data provided by Agency: Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). Available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/License-Applications/ptev-4hud. This data set features license applications received during the last and current calendar years (2020 and 2021), including applications where a license was issued, denied, withdrawn, or remains pending. For a list of legally operating businesses, please refer to the DCA – Legally Operating Businesses data set referenced above. The following variables were of interest to us: Business Industry type (Tobacco dealer, Home Improvement Contractor, etc) Business location (includes Zip, Borough, Council District, Longitudes, Latitudes) Application status (Issued, Denied, Withdrawn, Pending) License acceptance date Application Type Variables of the License Applications in New York City ## [1] &quot;Application.ID&quot; &quot;License.Number&quot; &quot;License.Type&quot; &quot;Application.or.Renewal&quot; ## [5] &quot;Business.Name&quot; &quot;Status&quot; &quot;Start.Date&quot; &quot;End.Date&quot; ## [9] &quot;Temp.Op.Letter.Issued&quot; &quot;Temp.Op.Letter.Expiration&quot; &quot;License.Category&quot; &quot;Application.Category&quot; ## [13] &quot;Building.Number&quot; &quot;Street&quot; &quot;Street.2&quot; &quot;Unit.Type&quot; ## [17] &quot;Unit&quot; &quot;Description&quot; &quot;City&quot; &quot;State&quot; ## [21] &quot;Zip&quot; &quot;Contact.Phone&quot; &quot;Longitude&quot; &quot;Latitude&quot; ## [25] &quot;Active.Vehicles&quot; "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Legally Operating Businesses 3.2 License Applications", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We are using two datasets containing information about different types of licences issued in and around New York City. Our primal data set is the legally operating businesses data set containing most of the information we need and is used for the majority of the plots we generate. The licence applications dataset is used to plot the acceptance ratio across various boroughs. The challenge was to create a column which was similar to the address borough column in the legally operating businesses dataset as the column closest to that in the license applications was the City column which has Manhattan and Queens missing as Boroughs and has a lot of other entries as well which are not present in the Address borough column in our primal dataset. 3.1 Legally Operating Businesses On plotting the count of licences across the Address Borough column we notice that a lot of boroughs have been named twice. And the duplicate names with all capital letters have negligible rows in the dataset. Hence, we remove the entries with Address Borough values as “BRONX”,“QUEENS”,“BROOKLYN” and “MANHATTAN”. To plot a graph showing the length of the licenses given to various industries we calculated the number of days between license creation and expiration date. During this we found that a lot of these values are negative. Hence we removed all such cases as well as it does not make sense for the license to expire before it is created. While doing the missing data analysis mentioned in Chapter 4 we found out that the columns Secondary Address Street Name, Detail and Business Name 2 have more than 75% values missing. Since these columns are not used by us anywhere, we remove these as well. 3.2 License Applications We have created a new dataset having columns corresponding to the year of the “End Date” column, the “Status” column and the “License.Category” column from the License Applications dataset. We also have created a new column called “nyc.data.borough” which tells as to which borough the license application belongs to. This column was created by looking at the Zip Codes corresponding to the 5 boroughs i.e. Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, Queens and Manhattan in the Legally Operating Businesses dataset and then mapping Zip codes in the License applications dataset to these boroughs. This enables us to see the acceptance rates in various boroughs across NYC over the years. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Legally Operating Businesses", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Legally Operating Businesses We get 364 missing patterns in our dataset which we believe is reasonable since we had ~300,000 observations in our data. Further, our original dataset has 27 columns in total. As we can see 3 columns have more than 75% values missing. These columns are Secondary Street Name, Detail (open text variable describing the business), and Business Name 2 (for eg. McDonald’s BN2 is McD). We drop these 3 columns to improve our missing pattern analysis. To improve the visibility of our graph further we drop all the missing patterns with count &lt;=50 (&lt;0.016% observations). This step simply help us in building a neater and more readable graphic without losing out on any crucial information. Note that these two steps won’t have any impact on the percentage of missing patterns or percentage of missing column values since they both are essentially just trimming the height and width of the original graphic. Observations: 1. Post processing the dataset we find 30 most frequently occurring missing patterns. 2. As we can see, the missing pattern with complete cases tops the list which is a positive news for our analysis. This in a way also validates our decision to remove the three columns with more than 75% missing values. As we can see in the plot above ‘complete cases’ initially lied pretty much in the middle of the plot. 3. We notice that the columns with most missing values are either redundant columns or not really helping in answering the three questions we aim to probe. For instance, BrC (Borough Code) is redundant since we already have the Address Borough (AddressBr). Also, CnP (contact phone number) plays no role in our analysis. The same holds for most other columns except location, latitude, and longitude. Most of the important columns for our analysis e.g. Industry type(Ind), Zip Code(AZI), License Type(LcT), Expiration Date (LED) have negligible missing values. 4. We also notice that latitude, longitude and the location i.e, (lat, long) are missing in tandem to each other i.e, either all the three are missing or all the three are present.

There is no split between active and inactive licenses for home improvement Salesperson and that is because all of these licenses have expired and are inactive (which we can infer from the heat maps shown below split by License Status). Most of the industries have more inactive licenses than active licenses. But there are a few exceptions like Laundries and Electronic Cigarette Dealerships where we have more active licenses than inactive licenses. Looking at the split between license types we see that there are no industries with both License type Individual and Business. Most of the industries have license type Business, only a few Industries like Locksmith, projectionist, home improvement salesperson, general vendors etc. have been issued licenses of individual type. 5.4 Total licences across industries over 20 years We can clearly see that the tobacco retail dealer licenses have gradually decreased over the last 20 years. The electronic cigarette dealership licenses did not exist before 2018 as these dealerships were legally given licenses in 2018. We can see the sudden increase in the number of licenses in 2018 and how it drastically drops as a lot of studies showed how teenagers were getting addicted to vapes and eventually in July of 2020 they were banned in the city of New York. For the heatmap split between active and inactive licenses we can clearly see that Industries like Ticket Seller Businesses, Sightseeing Bus, Motion Picture Projectionist, Catering Establishments, Cabaret etc. have no active licenses. And this makes sense because all these industries have been heavily affected by covid.

We have bundled this heatmap into a shiny app and deployed it using the servers offered by shinyapps.io. Anyone can use the link above to access the app and play around with different industries and years that they want to dive deep on. Through this app we wanted the users to study and explore for themselves what areas (both at borough and zipcode level) have had lower acceptance rates as compared to their peers. For instance, we can see that Bronx has had marginally lower license acceptance rates as compared to other boroughs throughout the last 7 years across most industries. Dataset used: We have used the Business License Applications dataset to create the visualizations here. Though the data contains information on licenses dating back to the year 2000, the information is pretty much sparse. Hence, for the app to produce any meaningful visualizations we have only used the data starting from 2014 going upto 2021.
